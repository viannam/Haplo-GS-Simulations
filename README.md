Haplotype-based Genomic Selection models in simulated maize populations.
# ðŸŒ½ Genomic Selection Simulation Pipeline in Maize

This repository contains an R-based simulation pipeline for evaluating the long-term effects of genomic selection (GS) strategies in maize breeding. The simulation models realistic breeding programs over 30 years using **AlphaSimR**, comparing SNP- and haplotype-based genomic selection under different trait architectures and population structures.

> Developed with support from [Dr. Marco A. Peixoto](https://github.com/marcopxt)

*Figure: Schematic overview of the breeding pipeline implemented in the simulation.*

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This pipeline simulates:

- A realistic maize breeding program with testcross stages
- Burn-in and future breeding cycles (e.g., 15 years + 20 years)
- Multiple GS scenarios using SNPs, QTLs, and haplotypes
- Metrics like genetic gain, variance, inbreeding, and LD
- Genomic selection via the **GBLUP model** using the `BGLR` package

---

## ðŸ§¬ Scenarios Simulated

Each scenario varies the markers used to build the genomic relationship matrix:

- `SNP`: Standard SNP-based GS
- `Haplo`: Haplotype-based GS using sliding windows
- `SNP_QTL`: SNPs located at known QTL positions
- `Haplo_QTL`: Haplotype blocks constructed from known QTLs

All simulations track genetic trends across 35 years (15 burn-in + 20 selection cycles).
